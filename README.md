# flask-clock
Clock, made with flask, help...

## installation?
I can only think you want to install this, to add, to a Raspberry Pi or smth, but anyway:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Null-Austin/flask-clock
```
Then, after you get it installed, gota swap dirs.
```sh
cd flask-clock
```
So close! Make sure you have flask!
```sh
pip install flask
```
And now, wer- no
```sh
python clock.py
```
ok, im done, -enjoy!
